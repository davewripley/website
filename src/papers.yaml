  abstract: "This chapter examines some aspects of the influence of the sorites paradox in psychology. Section 1 starts out with a brief discussion of the analysis of slippery slope arguments in the psychology of reasoning, to introduce the relevance of probabilistic considerations in that domain. We then devote most of this chapter to the analysis in psychophysics and in the psychology of concepts of the complex relationship between discrimination and categorization for items that differ very little. Section 2 emphasizes the centrality of probabilistic modeling to represent the way in which small differences between stimuli affect decisions of membership under a common category. Section 3 focuses on experimental data concerning unordered transitions between prototypes, then section 4 looks at data concerning ordered transitions between prototypes (dynamic sorites)."

  abstract: "The principle of tolerance characteristic of vague predicates is sometimes presented as a soft rule, namely as a default which we can use in ordinary reasoning, but which requires care in order to avoid paradoxes. We focus on two ways in which the tolerance principle can be modeled in that spirit, using special consequence relations. The first approach relates tolerant reasoning to nontransitive reasoning; the second relates tolerant reasoning to nonmonotonic reasoning. We compare the two approaches and examine three specific consequence relations in relation to those, which we call: strict-to-tolerant entailment, pragmatic-to-tolerant entailment, and pragmatic-to-pragmatic entailment. The first two are nontransitive, whereas the latter two are nonmonotonic."

We show how to extend the counterfactual theory of explanation to non-causal cases, involving extra-mathematical explanation: the explanation of physical facts (in part) by mathematical facts. Using a structural-equation framework, we model impossible perturbations to mathematics and the resulting differences made to physical explananda in two important cases of extra-mathematical explanation. We then address some objections to our approach."

  abstract: In a recent series of papers, I and others have advanced new logical approaches
    to familiar paradoxes. The key to these approaches is to accept full classical
    logic, and to accept the principles that cause paradox, while preventing trouble
    by allowing a certain sort of nontransitivity. Earlier papers have treated paradoxes
    of truth and vagueness. The present paper begins to extend the approach to deal
    with the familiar paradoxes arising in naive set theory, pointing out some of
    the promises and pitfalls of such an approach.

  abstract: ! 'In  an  approach  to  vagueness  using  the  paraconsistent logic LP,  borderline
    cases of vague predicates are contradictory---logical gluts. In â€˜Finding Tolerance
    without Glutsâ€™, Jc Beall argues against such an account of vagueness. He constructs
    an alternative theory, and argues that â€˜[t]he result enjoys all the virtues of  the
    LP solution but without the glutsâ€™. He concludes that his alternative is therefore
    preferable to the LP solution. In what follows, we will demonstrate that this
    is not the case: Beallâ€™s account does not do all the things that a paraconsistent
    solution can do. In fact, it is the other way around: the paraconsistent account
    can do everything that Beallâ€™s theory can do, and more. And some of the â€˜moreâ€™
    is very important. We will demonstrate this by discussing each of the three objections
    to his own project which Beall raises and rejects, arguing that his replies fail
    in each case. This note is not solely a reply to Beall. Several quite new points
    emerge  in  the  discussion, clarifying the paraconsistent account.'

  abstract: Recent experiments have shown that naive speakers find borderline contradictions
    involving vague predicates acceptable. In "Tolerant, classical, strict", we proposed
    a pragmatic explanation of the acceptability of borderline contradictions, building
    on a three-valued semantics. In a reply, Alxatib et al. show, however,  that  the  pragmatic  account  predicts  the  wrong  interpretations  for  some
    examples involving disjunction, and propose as a remedy a semantic analysis instead,
    based on fuzzy logic. In this paper we provide an explicit global pragmatic interpretation
    rule, based on a somewhat richer semantics, and show that with its help the problem
    can be overcome in pragmatics after all. Furthermore, we use this pragmatic interpretation
    rule to define a new (nonmonotonic) consequence relation and discuss some of its
    properties.

  abstract: In  some  logics, anything  whatsoever  follows  from  a  contradiction;  call
    these logics explosive. Paraconsistent logics are logics that are not explosive.
    Paraconsistent logics have a long and fruitful history, and no doubt a long and
    fruitful future. To give some sense of the situation, I spend Section 1 exploring
    exactly what it takes for a logic to be paraconsistent. It will emerge that there
    is considerable open texture to the idea. In Section 2, I give some examples of
    techniques for developing paraconsistent logics. In Section 3, I discuss what
    seem to me to be some promising applications of certain paraconsistent logics.
    In fact, however, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s all that much to the concept â€˜paraconsistentâ€™
    itself; the collection of paraconsistent logics is far too heterogenous to be
    very productively dealt with under a single label. Perhaps that will emerge as
    we go.

  abstract: We say that a sentence A is a permissive consequence of a set X of premises
    whenever, if all the premises in X hold up to some standard, then A holds to some
    weaker standard. In this paper, we focus on a three-valued version of this notion,
    which we call strict-to-tolerant consequence, and discuss its fruitfulness toward
    a unified treatment of the paradoxes of vagueness and self-referential truth.
    For vagueness, st-consequence supports the principle of tolerance; for truth,
    it supports the requisite of transparency. Permissive consequence is non-transitive,
    but this feature is argued to be an essential component to the understanding of
    paradoxical reasoning in cases involving vagueness or self-reference.

  abstract: This paper proposes an experimental investigation of the use of vague
    predicates in dynamic sorites. We present the results of two studies in which
    subjects had to categorize colored squares at the borderline between two color
    categories. Our main aim was to probe for hysteresis in the ordered transitions
    between the respective colors, namely for the longer persistence of the initial
    category. Our main finding is a reverse phenomenon of enhanced contrast (i.e.
    negative hysteresis), present in two different tasks, a comparative task involving
    two color names, and a yes/no task involving a single color name, but not found
    in a corresponding color matching task. We propose an optimality-theoretic explanation
    of this effect in terms of the strict-tolerant framework of Cobreros et al.'s
    "Tolerant, classical, strict", in which borderline cases are characterized in
    a dual manner in terms of overlap between tolerant extensions, and underlap between
    strict extensions.

  abstract: This paper presents and defends a way to add a transparent truth predicate
    to classical logic, such that T(A) and A are everywhere intersubstitutable, where
    all T-biconditionals hold, and where truth can be made compositional. A key feature
    of our framework, called STTT (for Strict-Tolerant Transparent Truth), is that
    it supports a non-transitive relation of consequence. At the same time, it can
    be seen that the only failures of transitivity STTT allows for arise in paradoxical
    cases.

  abstract: This paper provides a defense of the full strength of classical logic,
    in  a  certain  form,  against  those  who  would  appeal  to  semantic  paradox
    or vagueness in an argument for a weaker logic. I will not argue that these paradoxes
    are based on mistaken principles; the approach I  recommend  will  extend  a  familiar  formulation  of  classical  logic  by
    including a fully transparent truth predicate and fully tolerant vague predicates.
    It has been claimed that these principles are not compatible with classical logic;
    I will argue, by both drawing on previous work and presenting new work in the
    same vein, that this is not so. We can combine  classical  logic  with  these  intuitive  principles,  so  long  as  we
    allow the result to be nontransitive. In the end, I hope the paper will help us
    to handle familiar paradoxes within classical logic; along the way, I hope to
    shed some light on what classical logic might be for.

  abstract: ! 'This paper presents and motivates a new philosophical and logical approach
    to truth and semantic paradox. It begins from an inferentialist, and particularly
    bilateralist, theory of meaningâ€”one which takes meaning to be constituted by assertibility
    and deniability conditionsâ€”and shows how the usual multiple-conclusion sequent
    calculus for classical logic can be given an inferentialist motivation, leaving
    classical model theory as of only derivative importance. The paper then uses this
    theory of meaning to present and motivate a logical system--â€”ST--â€”that conservatively
    extends classical logic with a fully transparent truth predicate. This system
    is shown to allow for classical reasoning over the full (truth-involving) vocabulary,
    but to be non-transitive. Some special cases where transitivity does hold are
    outlined. ST is also shown to give rise to a familiar sort of model for non-classical
    logics: Kripke fixed points on the Strong Kleene valuation scheme. Finally, to
    give a theory of paradoxical sentences, a distinction is drawn between two varieties
    of assertion and two varieties of denial. On one variety, paradoxical sentences
    cannot be either asserted or denied; on the other, they must be both asserted
    and denied. The target theory is compared favourably to more familiar related
    systems, and some objections are considered and responded to.'

  abstract: ! 'For some reason, participants hold agents more responsible for their
    actions when a situation is described concretely than when the situation is described
    abstractly. We present examples of this phenomenon, and survey some attempts to
    explain it. We divide these attempts into two classes: affective theories and
    cognitive theories. After criticizing both types of theories we advance our novel
    hypothesis: that people believe that whenever a norm is violated, someone is responsible
    for it. This belief, along with the familiar workings of cognitive dissonance
    theory, is enough to not only explain all of the abstract/concrete paradoxes,
    but also explains seemingly unrelated effects, like the anthropomorphization of
    malfunctioning inanimate objects.'

  abstract: ! 'This paper discusses two distinct strategies that have been adopted
    to provide fine-grained propositions; that is, propositions individuated more
    finely than sets of possible worlds. One strategy takes propositions to have internal
    structure, while the other looks beyond possible worlds, and takes propositions
    to be sets of circumstances, where possible worlds do not exhaust the circumstances.
    The usual arguments for these positions turn on fineness-of-grain issues: just
    how finely should propositions be individuated? Here, I compare the two strategies
    with an eye to the fineness-of-grain question, arguing that when a wide enough
    range of data is considered, we can see that a circumstance-based approach, properly
    spelled out, outperforms a structure-based approach in answering the question.
    (Part of this argument involves spelling out what I take to be a reasonable circumstance-based
    approach.) An argument to the contrary, due to Soames, is also considered.'

  abstract: In a previous paper (â€˜Tolerant, Classical, Strictâ€™), we investigated a
    semantic framework to deal with the idea that vague predicates are tolerant, namely
    that small changes do not affect the applicability of a vague predicate even if
    large changes do.  Our approach there rests on two main ideas.  First, given a
    classical extension of a predicate, we can define a strict and a tolerant extension
    depending on an indifference relation associated to that predicate. Second, we
    can use these notions of satisfaction to define mixed consequence relations that
    capture non-transitive tolerant reasoning. Although we gave some empirical motivation
    for the use of strict and tolerant extensions, making use of them commits us to
    the view that classical tautologies or contradictions are not automatically valid
    or unsatisfiable, respectively. Some philosophers might take this commitment as
    a negative outcome of our previous proposal.  We think, however, that the general
    ideas underlying our previous approach to vagueness can be implemented in a variety
    of ways.  This paper explores the possibility of defining mixed notions of consequence
    in the more classical super/sub-valuationist setting and examines to what extent
    any of these notions captures non-transitive tolerant reasoning.

  abstract: This paper shows how to conservatively extend a classical logic with a
    transparent truth predicate, in the face of the paradoxes that arise as a consequence.
    All classical inferences are preserved, and indeed extended to the full (truth-involving)
    vocabulary. However, not all classical metainferences are preserved; in particular,
    the resulting logical system is nontransitive. Some limits on this nontransitivity
    are adumbrated, and two proof systems are presented and shown to be sound and
    complete. (One proof system features admissible Cut, but the other does not.)

  abstract: One of the most dominant approaches to semantics for relevant (and many
    paraconsistent) logics is the Routleyâ€“Meyer semantics involving a ternary relation
    on points. To some (many?), this ternary relation has seemed like a technical
    trick devoid of an intuitively appealing philosophical story that connects it
    up with conditionality in general. In this paper, we respond to this worry by
    providing three different philosophical accounts of the ternary relation that
    correspond to three conceptions of conditionality. We close by briefly discussing
    a general conception of conditionality that may unify the three given conceptions.

  abstract: ! 'In this paper we investigate a semantics for first-order logic originally
    proposed by R. van Rooij to account for the idea that vague predicates are tolerant,
    that is, for the principle that if x is P, then y should be P whenever y is  similar  enough  to
    x.  The  semantics,  which  makes  use  of  indifference relations to model similarity,
    rests on the interaction of three notions of truth: the classical notion,  and  two  dual  notions  simultaneously  defined  in  terms
    of it, which we call tolerant truth and strict truth. We characterize the space
    of consequence relations definable in terms of those and discuss the kind of solution  this  gives  to  the  sorites  paradox.  We  discuss  some  applications  of
    the  framework  to  the  pragmatics  and  psycholinguistics  of  vague  predicates,
    in particular regarding judgments about borderline cases.'

  abstract: ! 'At least since Frege and Geach, there has been some consensus about
    the relation between negation, the speech act of denial, and the attitude of rejection:
    a denial, the consensus has  had  it,  is  the  assertion  of  a  negation,  and  a  rejection  is  a  belief  in  a  negation.  Recently,
    though, there have been notable deviations from this orthodox view. Rejectivists
    have maintained that negation is to be explained in terms of denial or rejection,
    rather than vice versa. Some other theorists have maintained that negation is
    a separate phenomenon from denial, and that neither is to be explained in terms
    of the other. In this paper, I present and consider these heterodox theories of
    the relation between negation, denial, and rejection.'

  abstract: Some theorists think that the more we get to know about the neural underpinnings
    of our behaviors, the less likely we will be to hold people responsible for their
    actions. This intuition has driven some to suspect that as neuroscience gains
    insight into the neurological causes of our actions, people will cease to view
    others as morally responsible for their actions, thus creating a troubling quandary
    for our legal system. This paper provides empirical evidence against such intuitions.
    Particularly, our studies of folk intuitions suggest that (1) when the causes
    of an action are described in neurological terms, they are not found to be any
    more exculpatory than when described in psychological terms, and (2) agents are
    not held fully responsible even for actions that are fully neurologically caused.
